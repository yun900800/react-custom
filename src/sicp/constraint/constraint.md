# 使用约束系统进行建模的一些例子

1. 摄氏温度与华氏温度之间的转换

2. a currency converter system that converts between USD, EUR, and GBP. This example will demonstrate how a constraint system can be used to manage multiple interdependent variables.
    - Connectors: To hold the values of USD, EUR, and GBP.
    - Constraints: To define the relationships between the currencies based on fixed exchange rates.
    - Dispatcher: To handle messages sent to connectors and constraints.

3. a scheduling system that manages appointments based on constraints such as availability, duration, and dependencies. This example will showcase how a constraint system can handle complex scheduling scenarios.
    - Connectors: Represent time slots for appointments.
    - Constraints: Define relationships between appointments, availability, and dependencies.
    - Dispatcher: Manage messages sent to connectors and constraints.
